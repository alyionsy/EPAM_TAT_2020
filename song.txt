I was there when you fell from the clouds
And landed in the desert
There was a thunder inside of my heart
There was a wonderful pleasure
And like a stallion racing the rain
You rode on the back of my bike
I knew from the song that you sang
You were my lover for life
Oh, there's no time to sleep
Oh, living in a dream
So take me to the paradise
It's in your eyes
Green like american money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Paradise, it's in your eyes
Green like american money
So we took to the Calico road
Running from the weather
There was a highway inside of her eyes
There was a buried treasure
And we got caught in the storm
You started flying a kite
At the end was the key to my heart
You were my lover for life
Oh, there's no time to sleep
Oh, living in a dream
So take me to the paradise
It's in your eyes
Green like american money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Paradise, it's in your eyes
Green like american money
We carved our love in the mountainside
We soaked our hearts in the rain
And I, waited my whole life, for you
So take me to the paradise
It's in your eyes
Green like american money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Paradise, it's in your eyes
Green like american money
